.SH "NAME"
pam_access \- PAM module for logdaemon style login access control
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBpam_access\&.so\fR\ 'u
\fBpam_access\&.so\fR [debug] [noaudit] [nodefgroup] [nodns] [quiet_log] [accessfile=\fIfile\fR] [fieldsep=\fIsep\fR] [listsep=\fIsep\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The pam_access PAM module is mainly for access management\&. It provides logdaemon style login access control based on login names, host or domain names, internet addresses or network numbers, or on terminal line names, X
\fI$DISPLAY\fR
values, or PAM service names in case of non\-networked logins\&.
.PP
By default rules for access management are taken from config file
/etc/security/access\&.conf
or, if that one is not present, the file
/usr/share/pam/security/access\&.conf\&. These settings can be overruled by setting in a config file explicitly specified with the
\fBaccessfile\fR
option\&. Then individual
*\&.conf
files from the
/etc/security/access\&.d/
and
/usr/share/pam/security/access\&.d
directories are read\&. If
/etc/security/access\&.d/@filename@\&.conf
exists, then
/usr/share/pam/security/access\&.d/@filename@\&.conf
will not be used\&. All
access\&.d/*\&.conf
files are sorted by their
@filename@\&.conf
in lexicographic order regardless of which of the directories they reside in\&. The effect of the individual files is the same as if all the files were concatenated together in the order of parsing\&. This means that once a pattern is matched in some file no further files are parsed\&. If a config file is explicitly specified with the
\fBaccessfile\fR
option the files in the above directories are not parsed\&.
.PP
If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report when it denies access based on origin (host, tty, etc\&.)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
accessfile=/path/to/access\&.conf
.RS 4
Indicate an alternative
access\&.conf
style configuration file to override the default\&. This can be useful when different services need different access lists\&.
.RE
.PP
debug
.RS 4
A lot of debug information is printed with
\fBsyslog\fR(3)\&.
.RE
.PP
noaudit
.RS 4
Do not report logins from disallowed hosts and ttys to the audit subsystem\&.
.RE
.PP
nodefgroup
.RS 4
User tokens which are not enclosed in parentheses will not be matched against the group database\&. The backwards compatible default is to try the group database match even for tokens not enclosed in parentheses\&.
.RE
.PP
nodns
.RS 4
Do not try to resolve tokens as hostnames, only IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will be resolved\&. Which means to allow login from a remote host, the IP addresses need to be specified in
access\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
quiet_log
.RS 4
Do not log denials with
\fBsyslog\fR(3)\&.
.RE
.PP
fieldsep=separators
.RS 4
This option modifies the field separator character that pam_access will recognize when parsing the access configuration file\&. For example:
\fBfieldsep=|\fR
will cause the default `:\*(Aq character to be treated as part of a field value and `|\*(Aq becomes the field separator\&. Doing this may be useful in conjunction with a system that wants to use pam_access with X based applications, since the
\fBPAM_TTY\fR
item is likely to be of the form "hostname:0" which includes a `:\*(Aq character in its value\&. But you should not need this\&.
.RE
.PP
listsep=separators
.RS 4
This option modifies the list separator character that pam_access will recognize when parsing the access configuration file\&. For example:
\fBlistsep=,\fR
will cause the default ` \*(Aq (space) and `\et\*(Aq (tab) characters to be treated as part of a list element value and `,\*(Aq becomes the only list element separator\&. Doing this may be useful on a system with group information obtained from a Windows domain, where the default built\-in groups "Domain Users", "Domain Admins" contain a space\&.
.RE
.SH "MODULE TYPES PROVIDED"
.PP
All module types (\fBauth\fR,
\fBaccount\fR,
\fBpassword\fR
and
\fBsession\fR) are provided\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
PAM_SUCCESS
.RS 4
Access was granted\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_PERM_DENIED
.RS 4
Access was not granted\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_IGNORE
.RS 4
\fBpam_setcred\fR
was called which does nothing\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_ABORT
.RS 4
Not all relevant data or options could be gotten\&.
.RE
.PP
PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
.RS 4
The user is not known to the system\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/etc/security/access\&.conf
.RS 4
Default configuration file
.RE
.PP
/usr/share/pam/security/access\&.conf
.RS 4
Default configuration file if
/etc/security/access\&.conf
does not exist\&.

.SH "AUTHORS"
.PP
The logdaemon style login access control scheme was designed and implemented by Wietse Venema\&. The pam_access PAM module was developed by Alexei Nogin <alexei@nogin\&.dnttm\&.ru>\&. The IPv6 support and the network(address) / netmask feature was developed and provided by Mike Becher <mike\&.becher@lrz\-muenchen\&.de>\&.
